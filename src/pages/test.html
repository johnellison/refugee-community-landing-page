        <h2>USING DESIGN THINKING WHEN BUILDING APPS FOR REFUGEES</h2>
        <p>
          When humanitarian disasters like the refugee crisis occur, individuals and  groups around the globe want to help, they just don’t know how. Simultaneously, crisis relief efforts are fragmented, often duplicative, and scattered across the web. This makes it difficult for <strong>volunteers</strong>, <strong>refugees</strong>, and <strong>donors</strong> to find exactly what they are looking for, and for pilot projects to take root and scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision for the platform is to provide a searchable, accurate, up-to-date repository of refugee relief projects across Europe and the Middle East. NGO staff, refugees, volunteers, and donors can add projects and search for initiatives by standardized categories, location, and project status.  By connecting volunteers all over the world with NGOs and groups making a difference on the ground,  Prosper reduces inefficiencies, supports the identification of replicable models, and allows for connections across sector.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Prosper emerged out of <a href="http://john-ellison.com/">John Ellison</a>'s response to the human suffering of the refugee crisis in Europe. Since launching an experimental landing page in October 2015, a global community of skilled digital workers has centralized around a single mission:
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            To transform the refugee crisis into an opportunity to foster an integrated society where every person is cherished and prosperity abounds.
        </strong></p>
        <p>
          If you want to learn more about Prosper’s background, values, and vision check out the <a href="/playbook.html">playbook</a> that John wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          In early 2016, frustrated by our research and duplication of efforts, our team decided to create a central repository of all refugee related initiatives.  By networking with initiatives across Europe, we aggregated a database that now includes almost 2,500 projects. After launching our Case for Support at <a href="http://refugeeprojects.com">RefugeeProjects.com</a>, we partnered with the Berlin based group, <a href="http://metacollect.org">metacollect</a>, who is developing an open data API for migrant initiatives in Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our revamped platform will launch in October, 2016 with improved search functionality, standardized humanitarian categories, and featured collections curated by Prosper volunteers.  Prosper is partnering with multiple institutions to ensure the long-term sustainability of this endeavor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prosper is currently a volunteer-run collective, with partners and fiscal sponsors operating in Greece, the U.S., and France.

        <h2>Values</h2>
        <h4>We are mission driven</h4>
        <p>
          Prosper exists to help refugees prosper in Europe. At Prosper, purpose is at the heart of everything we do. It is constantly evolving and reflects each individual as well as the organization as a whole. We express our purpose through our actions, in our writing, and in our lives. At its core, our approach is based on seeing mass migration as an opportunity for Europe, not a threat.
        </p>
        <h4>We are co-creators</h4>
        <p>
          We use human-centered design in our work. Whether the users are refugees, asylum seekers, NGO’s, or other stakeholders, our products are designed in collaboration with intended users.
        </p>
        <h4>Prosper is open source</h4>
        <p>
          Our products and approach celebrate open exchange, collaborative participation, transparency. We’re not just talking about code here. Open source means that we share resources, approaches, data, and intentionally collaborate with other actors in this space.
        </p>
        <h4>Diversity is a strength</h4>
        <p>
          We believe it is important to maintain diversity across gender, ethnicity, faith and discipline. At the same time, we realize that differences amongst people can create conflict. We value our ability to harness conflict as a vehicle for constructive change.
        </p>
        <h4>Trust is the basis of all that we do</h4>
        <p>
          We believe that people are good by nature and deserve to be trusted (unless proven otherwise).We allow and support experimentation, and risk-taking internally. We understand that people are imperfect, and thus forgiveness is an integral element in our foundation of trust.
        </p>
        <h4>We are a community of learners</h4>
        <p>
          We believe that everyone has something to teach and everyone has something to learn. Alone we can do nothing, but together, nothing is impossible.
        </p>
