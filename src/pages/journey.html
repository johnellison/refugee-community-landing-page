      <h2>Genesis</h2>
      <p>
        Prosper emerged out of <a href="http://john-ellison.com">John Ellison</a>'s response to the human suffering of the refugee crisis in Europe. Since launching an experimental landing page in October 2015, a global community of skilled digital workers has centralized around a single mission:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>to transform the refugee crisis into an opportunity to foster an integrated society where every person is cherished and prosperity abounds.</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>refugees welcome</h3>
      <p>
        John Ellison reached out to <a href="http://www.refugees-welcome.net/">Refugees Welcome</a> to offer the spare bedroom in his family's flat to a refugee. Several weeks later, John and his wife heard back from Refugees Welcome. They were humbled and overwhelmed at the response of the European community to host refugees in their home. Thousands of people reached out to Refugees Welcome in the span of a few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly the problem of housing refugees was no longer "how can we find them homes?" but "how can we match refugees with spare bedrooms that have been offered across Europe?".
      </p>
      <p>
        As John witnessed the problems of scale that Refugees Welcome was facing, he realized that his experience as a designer and developer had a huge potential to help refugees into homes. He also had a hunch that this wasn't the only problem of the refugee crisis that could be solved using technology and design.
      </p>
      <h3>speaking to jonas</h3>
      <p>
        John reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonasoulartiste">Jonas Kakoschke</a> to learn more about the problems that Jonas was facing in trying to match refugees to shared flats across Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were statements Jonas made that stood out above the rest:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        We don't have the luxury to step back and create proactive solutions&mdash;we only have time to react.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        We need skilled digital workers. There is so much that can be done, but so little time to do it. If you can provide this, it will make a very big difference.
      </blockquote>
      <h3>the prosper mvp</h3>
      <p>
        After speaking to Jonas, John quickly designed and developed a landing page that made a proposition to skilled digital workers to volunteer their time to help solve some of the problems of the refugee crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        He shared a few links with his design and development communities, and within half a day he had eight skilled digital workers expressed deep, purpose-driven interest.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I've been looking my entire life for something like this&mdash;a place where I can contribute my skills to a good cause, in my spare time, and know that I am making a significant difference in the lives of people who need it most.
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Finding Focus</h2>
      <p>
        In the following five weeks that ensued, the Prosper community grew by an average of 1.3 new members per day. As the community increased in size, so did the appetite to help. As with any new initiative, there are thousands of possibilities and it is difficult to find focus and figure out where to help best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jonas Kakoshcke of Refugees Welcome introduced Prosper to Fredric Landqvist, the founder of Refugees Welcome in Sweden. After several discussions with Fredric and his team, John realized that they needed more time to find focus and clarity about what the Prosper community would do, and how they would do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        John and several other Prosper team members spoke to communities on the ground across Europe who were trying to help refugees. They wanted to employ a human-centered design process to qualify any potential projects, and use the same process to gain insights about how they might solve any problems they identified.
      </p>
      <p>
        As discussed in the <a href="/projects/refugee-projects.html">RefugeeProjects.com project page</a>, the research process to identify our first project was difficult and painful. Witnessing human suffering is not something digital workers are used to doing in their work. No matter the form of our response to this suffering, it could not just be a 'project'. Our response had to be a deep and passionate commitment from our community to the community of the refugee crisis.
      </p>
      <h2>Our First Project</h2>
      <p>
        We consulted with the team and discussed our range of possible options for our first project. We had an explicit set of criteria for each project. We defined that any potential project must:
        <ul>
          <li>Solve a <strong>real human problem</strong> of the refugee crisis</li>
          <li>Be <strong>sustainable</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> and <strong>significant</strong></li>
          <li>Have solutions that are <strong>measurable</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        After several days of discussions on <a href="https://prosper-community.slack.com/">our Slack Team</a>, we decided to solve the following problem as our first project:
      </p>
      <p>
        Initiatives addressing the refugee crisis are scattered all across the web. This makes it difficult for <strong>refugees</strong>, <strong>volunteers</strong>, and <strong>donors</strong> to find exactly what they are looking for and leads to duplication of efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prototype for our solution is <a href="http://refugeeprojects.com">RefugeeProjects.com</a>.
